# Font Awesome 4.2.0 IE7
## IE7 Support for Font Awesome 4.2.0
### Introduction
This is an IE7 (and perhaps IE6) compatible version of Font Awesome 4.2.0 in SASS and CSS (LESS might be in the future if this finds any use). The font files are the same, as are most of the SASS files, but they are included for convenience. The modified SASS files are denoted with the ie7- prefix.

### How to use it
Using this tool is no more complicated than conditionally including the CSS file for IE7, or lt IE8. For SASS use, just include the main SASS file in your IE7 stylesheet and (obviously?) make sure you're not loading the regular version too.

### Disclaimer
This is brand new and barely tested. I have no idea if all the features work, but I do know that I saw icons on IE7 and that was nice.
